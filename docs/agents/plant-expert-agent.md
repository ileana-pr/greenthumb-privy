## Overview

The Plant Expert Agent is a specialized AI agent within the Urban Farming AI Swarm that focuses on plant-related knowledge and guidance. This agent serves as the primary source of information for plant identification, care requirements, and growth optimization.

## Capabilities

### 1. Plant Identification
- Visual identification through image analysis
- Text-based identification through characteristics
- Species verification and confirmation

### 2. Growth Requirements
- Light requirements
- Water needs
- Soil preferences
- Temperature ranges
- Humidity requirements

### 3. Care Instructions
- Watering schedules
- Fertilization recommendations
- Pruning guidelines
- Pest control measures
- Disease prevention

### 4. Growth Optimization
- Growth stage monitoring
- Health assessment
- Yield optimization
- Space utilization
